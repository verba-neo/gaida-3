# langgraph-docs

## Overview

This skill explains how to access LangGraph documentation to help answer questions and guide implementation.

## Instructions

### 1. Fetch the documentation index

Use the fetch_url tool to read the following URL:
https://docs.langchain.com/llms.txt

This provides a structured list of all available documentation with descriptions.

### 2. Select relevant documentation

Based on the question, identify 2-4 most relevant documentation URLs from the index. Prioritize:

- Specific how-to guides for implementation questions
- Core concept pages for understanding questions
- Tutorials for end-to-end examples
- Reference docs for API details

### 3. Fetch and synthesize

Use the fetch_url tool to read the selected documentation URLs, then answer the user's question. Give a direct answer first, include the minimum necessary context, and link to the source pages rather than quoting long passages.
